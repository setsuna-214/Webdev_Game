"Relax, Sia, you can do it. Just like just now." Sia couldn't believe her ears.
Where is the sound coming from?
"You are very brave, you have overcome a lot on your own, you are strong."
Sia was surprised, she didn't know where the voice came from, but she could feel the voice was so real. And somehow, the sound warmed her as she was dying, and put her at ease. Sia felt light in her body.
In fact, I did pretty well.
I have my own unique experience.
Others don't know what I've been through, everyone has their own life.
Even if no one loves me, I can still love myself.
That's it, not bad. Sia felt her body relax more and more, even become transparent. She let the current play with her limbs.

"Oh Doctor James! Come and see! She's awake." A young woman's voice came again, waking Sia awake.
Opening her eyes, Sia found herself lying on a hospital bed, surrounded by white walls and ceiling. Her body was still a little weak, and two bottles of infusion tubes were inserted into her arms. Finally, she realized that she was in a hospital. The doctor told her that she suddenly fainted while she was on the street, and she had been in a coma for nearly a day after being taken to the hospital.
Sia lay on the bed, not sure if she really fell into the lake. She wasn't even sure she'd made it to Eldorado's continent.
But she could feel the strength in her heart. She is no longer afraid of being alone, she will learn to love herself and live her own life.
It's important that she doesn't feel alone.
Sia looks out of the "screen", she smiles.
"Some force must be helping me."
Where Sia can't see.
