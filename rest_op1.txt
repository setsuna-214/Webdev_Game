Desperately trying to break free. Her body twisted violently, but her strength was simply not comparable to that of the militants. The sudden crisis reduced her bodily functions tenfold. Her arms hurt more from being pulled, her feet were dragged and her head was banged against the wall. 
Sia dug her fingernails into the militant's arm in a last-ditch effort. This completely enraged the militant, who yelled some words that Sia couldn't understand, and at the same time let go of Sia's arm, and hit Sia hard on the head with the butt of the gun. 
Sia knew that her life was almost at the end, and her arm being released did not mean release, but that the gangster lost the patience to keep her alive. The man raised his rifle and aimed it at Sia's head. Sia didn't want to see her own death. 
"Why is this happening?" No one knows the answer, maybe this is life, it's a drama. Everything happened so fast that Sia didn't have time to think too much about it. Time seems to freeze like air...
"...coffee or water...?"
".....coffee....?"
"Hi, would you like coffee or water?"
Sia woke up suddenly, subconsciously replied "please give me water".
It seems to have had a very long dream. Sia realizes that she has spent 3 hours on the plane. The flight will be to Eldorado. For some reason, Sia just fell asleep, but her body was extremely sore. The dream just now was still echoing in her mind, and she didn't know what it meant. Her heartbeat hadn't quite calmed down yet. The line between dreams and reality seems to be getting blurred. Sia didn't know if she was still dreaming, she didn't know if she was still on the plane, and she didn't know the meaning of this journey. She didn't know if she was still in this world. She doesn't even know if she's still Sia...
--> BAD END: unacceptable reality
