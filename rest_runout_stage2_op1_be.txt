You can only go east by instinct. Just judging which side is east is all that Sia can think about. Sia walked forward mechanically with heavy steps.
Repeated scene.
Still a repeat scene.
Earth, stones.
Another hour passed.
Earth, stones.
Sia probably lost her way. She was so tired that she forgot to make some marks along the way. She looked back into the distance, not remembering where she came from, nor where she should go. The endless loneliness invaded Sia's thoughts, and she started to cry out.
"Help!"
No one responded to her, no creature, it should be said.
After another half an hour, Sia, who could not see any hope, seemed to lose her mind. She suddenly lay down on the ground, letting the glare of the sun and the wind blowing against her body. She looked at the sky, her thoughts drifted further and further away...
Flying farther and farther...
Who can come and save her?
